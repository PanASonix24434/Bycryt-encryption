# Bcrypt Encryption Login System

This project is a cryptography assignment that implements secure user login functionality using **bcrypt** hashing for password encryption. It is developed using **JSP**, **MySQL**, and **Apache Tomcat**.

## Features
- User registration with password encryption using bcrypt
- User login with secure password verification
- Uses JSP for frontend, MySQL for database, and Tomcat as the server

## Objective
To demonstrate the application of bcrypt hashing in securing user credentials and preventing password-related attacks in web applications.

## Usage
1. Set up MySQL database and configure connection
2. Deploy the JSP project on Apache Tomcat server
3. Register new users and login securely with encrypted passwords
